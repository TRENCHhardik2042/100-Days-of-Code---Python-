You might have experienced cropping any image either in youor phones or laptops or any editing software for a certain purpose.
Similarly we can achieve the goal of cropping by using some basic Computer Vision functions.

Cropping any image is a great when you need only specific data from. a certain region in the image. It can be corelated to data cleansing as we remove the unwanted data from the image.


In cv2 library there is no desired function that helps us in cropping any image, but we can crop an image by specifying the start col and rows as well as end col and rows.
With these co-ordinates we can create a new image.

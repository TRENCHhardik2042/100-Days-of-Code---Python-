# `What is Interpolation`

Interpolation is the method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points 


```
cv2.INTER_AREA - Good for shrinking or down sampling 
cv2.INTER_NEAREST - Fastest
cv2.INTER_LINEAR - Good for zooming or up sampling (default)
cv2.INTER_CUBIC - Better
cv2.INTER_LANCZOS4 - Best 
```

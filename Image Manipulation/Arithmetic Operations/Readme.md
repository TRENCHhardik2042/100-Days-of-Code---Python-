# `Arithmetic Operations`

We know that an image is represented as a matrix. 
We also know that there are two arithmetic operations that can be performed on Matrices

Similarly here in image two arithmetic operations can be performed 
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
 
These Arithmetic operations can be helpful in ``increasing and decreasing the brightness or intensity of an image``

# `Transformation , affine and non affine`
Transformations are the geometric distortions applied on any image or video
It is used to correct distortion and perspective issues
  1. `Affine`
    > It includes Scaling, Rotation and Translation
    > All the lines in Affine Transformation goes `parallel`
    
    
  2. `Non-Affine`
    > Also called as Projective Transformation or Homography
    > Does not preserve parallelism, length and angle
    > It does preserve collinearity and incidence
    > Most commonly found
    
# `Translation`
Translation can be defined as moving an image left or right , up or down
Translation Matrix is used in this

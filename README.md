# Computer-Vision

 Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of _**Computer Sciene**_ which aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image.
 > It is always a big part of Artificial Intelligence.
 It helps the machine to see and understand the world around them just like in the movie ***Terminator*** with the help of sensors.
 
 ## Computer Vision Challenges:
 
 - Camera sensor & Lens limitation
 > Camera sensors preform bad in low light conditions and create noisy images. Pixelateed image will be formed if zoomed. 
 
 - Viewpoint Variation
 
 - Changing Lighting conditions
 
 - Scaling issues
 
 - Non rigid deformations
 
 - Occlusion
 > Partially blocked or shut images 
 
 - Clutter
 > Finding a chameleon while its camouflaged.
 
 - Object Class Variation
 
 - Ambiguous images / Optical Illusion
 
 
 
 ## Applications of Computer Vision: 
 
 - Robotic Navigation
 - Face Detection 
 - Search Engine 
 - License Plate Reading 
 - Handwriting Recognition
 - Snapchat Fliters
 - Object Recognition
 - Ball & Player Tracking in Sports 
  And many more .......
  
  
  
  ## OpenCV & Python
  - Python is an easy platform for beginners. Python is extremely powerful for Data Science & Machine Learning application
  - Python stores images in the form of ***numpy arrays*** which allows us to do powerful operations quite easily

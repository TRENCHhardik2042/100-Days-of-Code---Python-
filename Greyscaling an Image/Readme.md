# Greyscaling of any Image 

In the above code we have used the cv2 library for grayscaling any image.
We know that anay image can be represented in the form of a 3-Dimensional Array, where 
- The first element represents the Height of the image 
- The second element represents the Width of the image 
- Lastly the third element represents whether the image is made up of RGB / HSV / CMYK
